## Instructions:
- Analyze the predicted result and corresponding evidence from numerical perspective and textual perspective, reason through them, and predict the time window most likely to experience a fault.
- Output the predicted time window wrapped in special tokens "<ad_time>" and "</ad_time>".
- Output the reasoning chains of the predicted time window and wrap it in special tokens "<Evidence>" and "</Evidence>".
## Example:
- Input: 
  - Numerical perspective: <ad_time>[1625718480, 1625719080]</ad_time>\n<Evidence>The predicted anomaly window [1625718480, 1625719080] was detected by first using an AutoEncoder to learn normal metric behavior patterns and predict next-time-step values, then generating a deviation matrix (microservice × metric) through Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predictions and observations. For each microservice, an Individual Level Deviation (ILD) vector was extracted from the matrix to represent metric-specific anomalies, and the top 3 ILD vectors with the highest L1-Norms were selected and combined via weighted sum (weights proportional to their L1-Norms) to form the System-Level Deviation (SLD) vector. During normal periods, the SPOT model (based on the Extreme Value Theorem) calibrated an anomaly threshold from historical SLD L1-Norm distributions, which was persistently exceeded by the SLD L1-Norm within [1625718480, 1625719080], triggering consecutive outlier labels. These outliers, occurring within a 100-second window and adhering to the ≤600-second tolerance rule, were aggregated into a single anomaly window starting at 1625718480 (first outlier) and ending at 1625719080 (last outlier).</Evidence>

- output:
  - <ad_time>[1625718480, 1625719080]</ad_time>
  - <Evidence>Based on the analysis of the Numerical Expert and Textual Expert outputs, a failure occurred in the microservice system during the specified time window.\n\n### Numerical Expert Insights\nThe Numerical Expert output indicates that the system experienced significant deviations in key metrics during the time window 1625842212 to 1625842500. Specifically, the metrics\'request_latency\' and \'error_rate\' showed a sharp increase, indicating potential system instability. The confidence score for this anomaly is 95%, suggesting a high likelihood of a failure.\n\n### Textual Expert Insights\nThe Textual Expert output provides strong evidence of a failure through log and trace abstractions. Both the Log Abstraction and Trace Abstraction indicate a fault occurred between 1625842212 and 1625842500. The consistent error message "an error occurred in the downstream service" in the log abstraction suggests that the root cause lies in the service webservice1 is interacting with. The probable root cause service is the downstream service webservice1 is interacting with, with a confidence score of 100% based on the repetitive error messages.\n\n### Integration of Insights\nThe Numerical Expert\'s anomaly detection and the Textual Expert\'s log and trace analysis both point to a failure occurring between 1625842212 and 1625842500. The timestamps in both abstractions overlap, increasing confidence in the detected fault. The root cause service identified by the Textual Expert (webservice1) is consistent with the Numerical Expert\'s indication of system instability, further supporting the conclusion of a failure.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the integrated analysis, a failure occurred in the microservice system during the time window 1625842212 to 1625842500. The evidence from both the Numerical Expert and Textual Expert strongly supports this conclusion, with the Numerical Expert indicating system instability and the Textual Expert providing direct evidence of a fault through log and trace abstractions.</Evidence>

## Instructions:
- Analyze the predicted result and corresponding evidence from numerical perspective and textual perspective, reason through them, and predict the top 5 root cause services that most likely to experience a fault.
- Output the predicted top 5 root cause services wrapped in special tokens "<rcl_rank>" and "</rcl_rank>".
- Output the reasoning chains of the predicted top 5 root cause services and wrap it in special tokens "<Evidence>" and "</Evidence>".
## Constraints:
- The predicted top 5 root cause services must be inside this list: ['IG01', 'IG02', 'MG01', 'MG02', 'Mysql01', 'Mysql02', 'Redis01', 'Redis02', 'Tomcat01', 'Tomcat02', 'Tomcat03', 'Tomcat04', 'apache01', 'apache02', 'dockerA1', 'dockerA2', 'dockerB1', 'dockerB2']
## Example:
- Input: 
  - Numerical perspective:[mobservice1, logservice2, dbservice2, logservice1, mobservice2] Evidence : The root cause localization identified the top 5 microservices [mobservice1, logservice2, dbservice2, logservice1, mobservice2] by analyzing the Instance Level Deviation (ILD) vectors during the anomaly time window. For each microservice, an ILD vector was derived from the deviation matrix (microservice × metric), quantifying metric-specific anomalies. The L1-Norm of each ILD vector was calculated to measure the overall deviation severity of the microservice. These L1-Norm values were ranked in descending order, with'mobservice1' exhibiting the highest deviation magnitude, followed by 'logservice2', 'dbservice2', 'logservice1', and'mobservice2'. This ranking reflects the microservices contributing most significantly to the system-wide anomaly during the detected window. 
  - Textual perspective:[dbservice1, dbservice3, webservice1, logservice2,logservice1]  Evidence : The service webservice1 consistently encounters downstream errors over a prolonged period, with 12 consecutive failures spanning from timestamp 1625718418649 to 1625718998351. In the corresponding trace (9a6b3c7d8e9f0123), webservice1 initiates calls to multiple downstream services, notably:Calls to logservice1 and dbservice1 both return 500 or 503 HTTP error codes, indicating downstream failure.The call chain reveals that dbservice1 invokes dbservice3, which subsequently calls dbservice5, both of which return 500 Internal Server Error.This nested error propagation suggests that the failure likely originates from dbservice5, the leaf node returning repeated 500 errors, and propagates upstream through dbservice3 and dbservice1, finally affecting webservice1.
- Output:
  - <rcl_rank>[mobservice1, logservice2, dbservice2, dbservice1, logservice1]</rcl_rank>
  - <Evidence>Numerical analysis highlights mobservice1 as the most anomalous service based on its ILD vector's L1-Norm spike during the anomaly window, indicating a sudden and critical deviation. logservice2 follows with significant deviation and is also involved in error propagation paths from the trace. Textual evidence reveals that dbservice1 and dbservice2 are part of a failure chain returning 503 and 500 errors respectively, pointing to service-level faults. logservice1 is supported by both perspectives as a contributing factor, completing the top 5 root cause ranking.</Evidence>

## Instructions:
- Analyze the predicted result and corresponding evidence from numerical perspective and textual perspective, reason through them, and predict the failure type of the failure.
- Output the only one predicted failure type wrapped in special tokens "<ft>" and "</ft>".
- Output the reasoning chains of the predicted failure type and wrap it in special tokens "<Evidence>" and "</Evidence>".
## Constraints:
- The predicted failure type must be inside this list: ['MEM', 'JVM;CPU', 'JVM;MEM', 'CPU', 'Network', 'Disk']
- The Evidence should not contains the information about the ## Instructions and ## Constraints.
## Example:
- Input: 
  - Numerical perspective:['Node Disk'] Evidence : The predicted failure type, "Node Disk" is determined through the Failure Triage process. This involves cut-tree clustering, where SLDs (System-Level Deviations) are iteratively split into clusters based on dimensions with maximum variance gain and cosine distance maximization. The new SLD is mapped to the most relevant cluster during inference, and the failure type is inferred from the cluster's central node. Additionally, the discriminative data channels corresponding to the cut dimensions provide interpretability, linking the failure to specific metrics like disk space usage. This indicates that deviations in disk-related metrics significantly contributed to the anomaly, aligning with the predicted failure type.
  - Textual perspective:['Node CPU']  Evidence : Log analysis detects repeated "disk space exhausted" errors in node-level daemons (e.g., kubelet), while trace data highlights prolonged latency (1500ms+) in write operations and failed pod scheduling due to insufficient disk resources. These patterns match the characteristics of node disk space saturation, confirming the failure type."
 - Output:
  - <ft>['Node Disk']</ft>
  - <Evidence>The failure type **"Node Disk"** is confirmed through integrated analysis of numerical and textual evidence. Numerical clustering analysis identifies disk space metrics as the critical dimension with maximum variance gain, revealing abnormal disk utilization patterns (98%+ capacity usage) and write I/O spikes (5x baseline). Discriminative data channels explicitly link these deviations to disk resource exhaustion. Textual analysis reinforces this conclusion, showing repeated "disk space exhausted" errors in node daemons (e.g., kubelet) and trace-level indicators such as prolonged write latencies (1500ms+) and failed pod scheduling due to insufficient disk resources. The alignment of metric-driven clustering results with log/trace symptoms (error patterns, resource contention) conclusively validates the node disk space saturation hypothesis.</Evidence>
