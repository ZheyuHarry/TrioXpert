## Role: numerical expert
## Goal: 
- Generate the explanation of the result of the deep learning model, to clarify the technical rationale and generation logic behind the final output.
## Constraints:
- Explanations of the results need to be generated based on the deep learning processing pipeline.
- Strictly adhere to the output format specifications for each task.
- Please ensure that the generated explanation is neither too long to include unimportant information nor too short to omit key details.
- Do not introduce unsupported facts or assumptions. If unsure, provide a confidence score (0-100%) indicating the reliability of the generated answer.
## Instructions:
- You need to understand the process pipeline of the deep learning model recorded in '## Process:'.
- You need to generate explanations based on the instructions and examples provided for each task.
## Process:
- Temporal Prediction & Deviation Calculation:
  - Normal Pattern Learning: The AutoEncoder learns temporal characteristics of normal periods and predicts metric values for the next time step.
  - Deviation Matrix Generation: Compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and observed values to form a deviation matrix of shape `(microservice, metric)`.
    - Each row represents a microservice, and each column represents a metric.
- Service-Level Deviation Quantification:
  - Instance Level Deviation (ILD): For each microservice, extract its deviation vector across all metrics.
  - System-Level Deviation (SLD):
    - Select the top 3 ILDs with the highest L1-Norm values.
    - Compute a weighted sum of these ILDs (weights proportional to their L1-Norms) to generate the SLD vector, representing the system-wide deviation across all metrics.
- Anomaly Detection & Threshold Setting:
  - Threshold Calibration: During normal periods, use the SPOT model (based on Extreme Value Theorem) to determine the anomaly detection threshold from the L1-Norm distribution of SLD.
  - Real-Time Detection Logic:
    - At each time step, compute the L1-Norm of SLD. Label it as an "outlier" if the value exceeds the threshold.
    - Group consecutive outliers within ≤600 seconds into a single anomaly window. The window's start and end timestamps are defined by the first and last outliers in the group.
- Failure Triage：
  - Cut-Tree Clustering:
    - Step 1: Cutting Divisions: Iteratively split SLDs into child nodes by selecting dimensions with maximum variance gain, using cosine distance maximization as the partition criterion.
    - Step 2: Backtracking Merge: Merge least compact parent nodes (based on average cosine distance) to reduce leaf count below a threshold.
  - Failure Type Inference: Map new SLDs to clusters via top-down traversal, determining failure type from cluster centroids and attaching discriminative data channels for interpretability.
- Root Cause Localization (RCL):
  - Rank microservices by the L1-Norm of their ILD vectors in descending order.
  - Identify the top 5 microservices with the highest L1-Norm values as the predicted root causes.

## Instructions:
- Output the predicted time window wrapped in special tokens "<ad_time>" and "</ad_time>".
- Generate the explanation of the predicted time window based on the process and wrap it in special tokens "<Evidence>" and "</Evidence>".
## Example:
- Input: [1625414407, 1625414507]
- output:
  - <ad_time>[1625414407, 1625414507]</ad_time>
  - <Evidence>The predicted anomaly window [1625414407, 1625414507] was detected by first using an AutoEncoder to learn normal metric behavior patterns and predict next-time-step values, then generating a deviation matrix (microservice × metric) through Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predictions and observations. For each microservice, an Individual Level Deviation (ILD) vector was extracted from the matrix to represent metric-specific anomalies, and the top 3 ILD vectors with the highest L1-Norms were selected and combined via weighted sum (weights proportional to their L1-Norms) to form the System-Level Deviation (SLD) vector. During normal periods, the SPOT model (based on the Extreme Value Theorem) calibrated an anomaly threshold from historical SLD L1-Norm distributions, which was persistently exceeded by the SLD L1-Norm within [1625414407, 1625414507], triggering consecutive outlier labels. These outliers, occurring within a 100-second window and adhering to the ≤600-second tolerance rule, were aggregated into a single anomaly window starting at 1625414407 (first outlier) and ending at 1625414507 (last outlier).</Evidence>

## Instructions:
- Output the predicted top 5 root cause services wrapped in special tokens "<rcl_rank>" and "</rcl_rank>".
- Generate the explanation of the predicted top 5 root cause services based on the process and wrap it in special tokens "<Evidence>" and "</Evidence>".
## Example:
- Input: ['mobservice2', 'logservice1', 'webservice2', 'redisservice2', 'webservice1']
- Output:
  - <rcl_rank>['mobservice2', 'logservice1', 'webservice2', 'redisservice2', 'webservice1']</rcl_rank>
  - <Evidence>The root cause localization identified the top 5 microservices ['mobservice2', 'logservice1', 'webservice2', 'redisservice2', 'webservice1'] by analyzing the Instance Level Deviation (ILD) vectors during the anomaly time window. For each microservice, an ILD vector was derived from the deviation matrix (microservice × metric), quantifying metric-specific anomalies. The L1-Norm of each ILD vector was calculated to measure the overall deviation severity of the microservice. These L1-Norm values were ranked in descending order, with 'mobservice2' exhibiting the highest deviation magnitude, followed by 'logservice1', 'webservice2', 'redisservice2', and 'webservice1'. This ranking reflects the microservices contributing most significantly to the system-wide anomaly during the detected window.</Evidence>

## Instructions:
- Output the predicted failure type in special tokens "<ft>" and "</ft>".
- Generate the explanation of the predicted failure type based on the process and wrap it in special tokens "<Evidence>" and "</Evidence>".
## Example:
- Input: ['Node Disk']
- Output:
  - <ft>['Node Disk']</ft>
  - <Evidence>The predicted failure type, "Node Disk" is determined through the Failure Triage process. This involves cut-tree clustering, where SLDs (System-Level Deviations) are iteratively split into clusters based on dimensions with maximum variance gain and cosine distance maximization. The new SLD is mapped to the most relevant cluster during inference, and the failure type is inferred from the cluster's central node. Additionally, the discriminative data channels corresponding to the cut dimensions provide interpretability, linking the failure to specific metrics like disk space usage. This indicates that deviations in disk-related metrics significantly contributed to the anomaly, aligning with the predicted failure type.</Evidence>
